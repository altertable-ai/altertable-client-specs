name: build-readme
description: Defines how to write READMEs for Altertable open-source SDK repositories. Use when creating or updating a README for any SDK repo, monorepo root, or individual package. Covers monorepo root READMEs, per-package READMEs, section structure, tables, badges, and tone conventions.

# Build README Skill

## Overview

There are two README types in Altertable SDK repos:

1. **Monorepo root README** — describes the overall repository, its packages, examples, and development workflow.
2. **Package README** — describes a single installable package with install instructions, quick start, and API reference.

Use this skill to produce either type.

---

## Monorepo Root README

### Structure

```markdown
# {Repo Title}

{Badges: CI Status, Registry Version, License, etc. using shields.io}

{One-sentence description of what the repo contains and its purpose.}

## Packages

{Table: package path links, description, registry badge}

## Examples

{Table: example path, description, port, framework — only if examples exist}

## Quick Start

{Brief prose directing readers to per-package READMEs. No code block here.}

## Development

### Prerequisites

{Bullet list of required tools with installation links}

### Setup

{Single bash code block: install, build, test}

### Development Workflow

{Table: Step | Command | Description}

### Monorepo Scripts

{Table: Script | Description — all scripts in the root manifest}

## Testing

{Short description + bash block for common test commands}

## Releasing

{Numbered steps, referencing the GitHub Actions release workflow with a direct link}

## Documentation

{Bullet list linking to per-package READMEs and any API reference}

## Contributing

{Standard 5-step fork → PR flow}

## License

{Single link to the LICENSE file inside the first package, or root if present}

## Links

{Bullet list: Website, Documentation, GitHub repository}
```

### Conventions

- **Repo title**: Use the plain product name, e.g. `Altertable JavaScript SDK`. No monorepo jargon.
- **Top description**: One sentence. Mention language, purpose, and key quality words (e.g., "type-safe", "production-grade").
- **Packages table columns**: `Package` (linked name), `Description`, registry badge column (e.g., `NPM`, `PyPI`). Omit badge column for packages not on a registry.
- **Examples table columns**: `Example` (linked name), `Description`, `Port` (if applicable), `Framework`.
- **Badge format**: use `shields.io` npm/pypi/etc. badges linked to the registry page.
- **Quick Start section**: Do not duplicate install or code here. Link to per-package READMEs instead.
- **Development Workflow table columns**: `Step`, `Command`, `Description`.
- **Monorepo Scripts table columns**: `Script`, `Description`. List all scripts from the root manifest.
- **Testing section**: Include three commands — run all tests, run in watch mode, run for a specific package.
- **Releasing section**: Numbered steps ending with a link to the GitHub Actions release workflow URL.
- **Contributing**: Always the same 5-step flow (fork, branch, commit, push, PR).
- **License**: Link to the LICENSE file, not inline text.
- **Links section**: Always include Website (`https://altertable.ai`), Documentation (`https://altertable.ai/docs`), and GitHub Repository URL.

## Package README

Follow the structure defined in the [release-sdk](../release-sdk/SKILL.md) skill:

1. Title and Badges (CI Status, Registry Version, etc.)
2. One-line description
3. Install
4. Quick start
5. API reference
6. Configuration
7. License

### Additional conventions for Altertable packages

- **Install section**: Single command only. Use the canonical package manager for the ecosystem (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install`, `gem install`).
- **Quick start**: Provide the minimal working example — init + one `track` call (for analytics SDKs) or one query (for lakehouse SDKs). Keep it under 20 lines.
- **API reference**: Document every public method. Show the signature, a one-line description, and a usage example. Group by functional area (e.g., Identity, Tracking, Configuration).
- **Configuration**: Table with columns `Option`, `Type`, `Default`, `Description`. List all config keys.
- **Framework packages** (e.g., React): Add a "Usage" section between Quick Start and API Reference showing the provider setup and hooks.

---

## Tone and Style

- Write in second person ("You can…", "Call `track()`…"). Avoid first person.
- Use present tense ("Returns", "Sends", not "Will return", "Will send").
- Keep prose minimal — prefer tables and code blocks over paragraphs.
- Code blocks must be runnable as-is (no placeholder-only examples).
- Use inline code (backticks) for all method names, config keys, file paths, and commands.

## Example: Monorepo Root README

See the `altertable-js` repo for the canonical reference:
`https://github.com/altertable-ai/altertable-js`

Key patterns to replicate:

- Packages table with shields.io npm badges
- Development Workflow table (Step / Command / Description)
- Monorepo Scripts table covering all root-level scripts
- Testing section with three `bun run` variants
- Releasing section with link to the GitHub Actions workflow page
