# Shared Test Fixtures

These JSON files define the canonical expected output for standard SDK operations. All Altertable Product Analytics SDKs should include tests that load these fixtures, execute the described input, and verify the resulting payload matches the output exactly.

## How to Use

1.  **Load the Fixture:** Parse the JSON file in your test suite.
2.  **Execute:** Call your SDK method using the `input` parameters.
3.  **Mock Context:** Ensure your test environment uses the fixed values (e.g., `timestamp`, `anonymousId`, `library.version`) shown in the `output` to match the fixture.
4.  **Assert:** Compare the serialized JSON payload of your SDK's request against the `output.payload`.

## Fixture Index
